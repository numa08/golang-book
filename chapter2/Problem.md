## Problems

### What is whitescape?

Newlines , space and tabs

### What is commnent ? What are the two ways of writting comment ?

Comments are ignored by Go compiler and  are there for your own sake.

Go supports two different style of comment. First, line is stated by `//`.

Second, everything between `*` and start `/*` then end `*/`.

### Our program began with `package main`. What would the files in `fmt` package begin with?

That file began with `package fmt`.

### We used the `Println` function defined in the `fmt` package. If we wanted to use the `Exit` function from the `os` package what would we need to do ?

We would write `import os`, and write `os.Exit()`

### Modify the program we wrote so that insted of printing `Hello World` it prints `Hello, my name if` followed by your name.
