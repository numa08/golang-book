## Why do we use package ?

For code reuse.

## What is the difference between an identifier that starts with a capital letter and one which doesn't ?(`Average` vs `average`)

A function is started with capitalleter, but struct's method is not.

## What is a pacakge alias? How do you make one?

Package alias can name other name to package. We use `impor m "math"`. The `m` is package alias.

## We copied the average function from cahpter 7 to our new package. Create Min and Max function which find minimum and maximum values in a slice of float64.
